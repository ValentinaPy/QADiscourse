Wiki1k:wikinews:1450600:1:1	First of all , where were you born ?	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_
Wiki1k:wikinews:1450600:2:0	Tom Kyle : I was born in Cooma , in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales .	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_
Wiki1k:wikinews:1450600:2:3	Grew up in the Snowy Mountains Scheme with my family .	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_
Wiki1k:wikinews:1450600:2:4	At that stage my father worked for the Snowy scheme .	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_
Wiki1k:wikinews:1450600:3:0	-LRB- -LRB- WN -RRB- -RRB- So you took up basketball .	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_

Wiki1k:wikinews:1450600:8:12	So that gave me a good appreciation of coaching and the professionalism of it .	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_	_
